Week 3: Sub Rugby
====================

Theme:
Underwater rugby

Date:
11-01-2016 to 17-01-2016

Description:
Play rugby with submarines

Conclusion:
- the sonar bleep is wrong if the submarine does the following actions (shoot, move)
- no way to unselect a submarine after selection (the player may miss information in the log)
- lack of feedback when a turn is over and a new turn starts
- lack of a player chat ???
- lack of turn resolution animation
- lack of sound
- lack of after-action replay
- the submarines are too fast
- no undo on deployment
